# Fake news detection in online portals (FaNeD)
## Description:  
The data for this project will be collected as part of the project by utilizing open-source web-crawling engines + the BeuatifulSoup library for pulling out the textual content from the collected news entries. At least two different and well-known news portals will be analyzed. Texts analyzed will be in English and/or Hungarian. There will be a sentiment analysis and fake news processing stage(s). The collected news entries will be stored in Cassandra.
